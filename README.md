This is a Python script using the Kivy framework to create a simple app that allows the user to set a countdown timer and automatically shut down their Windows computer after a specified amount of time.

The app consists of a text input field where the user can enter the duration of the countdown (in minutes), a label that displays the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and three buttons: "Start", "Cancel", and "Exit".

When the user clicks the "Start" button, the script uses the os module to run a command in the command prompt to shut down the computer after the specified amount of time. It also starts a timer using the Clock module from Kivy to update the remaining time on the label every second.

If the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the script uses the os module to cancel the shutdown command.

If the user clicks the "Exit" button, the app is closed.

Additionally, there is a button that opens a web page to the developer's GitHub profile when clicked.
